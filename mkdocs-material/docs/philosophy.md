  [conventions]: #conventions

## Design principles

- __It's just Markdown__: Focus on the content of your documentation and create
  a professional static site in minutes. No need to know HTML,CSS or JavaScript
  – let Material for MkDocs do the heavy lifting for you.

- __Works on all devices__: Serve your documentation with confidence – the 
  underling layout automatically adapts to perfectly fit the available screen 
  estate, no matter the type or size of the viewing device.

- __Made to measure__: Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and much
  more with a few lines of configuration. Material for MkDocs can be easily 
  extended and provides tons of options to alter appearance and behavior.

- __Fast and lightweight__: Don't let your users wait – get incredible value
  with a small footprint, by using one of the fastest themes around with
  excellent performance, yielding great search engine rankings and happy
  users that return.

- __Accessible__: Make accessibility a priority – users can navigate your
  documentation with touch devices, keyboard, and screen readers. Semantic
  markup ensures that your documentation works for everyone.

- __Open Source__: Trust 20,000+ users – choose a mature and well-funded
  solution built with state-of-the-art Open Source technologies. Keep ownership
  of your content without fear of vendor lock-in. Licensed under MIT.

## Conventions

### Symbols

This documentation use some symbols for illustration purposes. Before you read
on, please make sure you've made yourself familiar with the following list of
conventions:

[:octicons-heart-fill-24:{ .mdx-heart } &nbsp; Insiders][Insiders]{ .mdx-insiders }

:   Some features are not yet available in the community edition, but only as
    part of the Insiders build of Material for MkDocs. Please consult the 
    [Insiders] guide to learn how to get access.

:octicons-tag-24: &nbsp; __{x.x.x}__

:   The tag icon in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific 
    feature or behavior was added. Make sure you're at least on this version
    if you want to use it.

:octicons-file-code-24: &nbsp; __{file.ext}__

:   The source file icon together with a file name is sometimes used in code
    examples which span multiple files. The file name (or path) always starts
    from the location of `mkdocs.yml`.

:octicons-milestone-24: &nbsp; __Default__: _value_

:   Some properties in `mkdocs.yml` have default values for when the author
    does not explicitly define them. The default value of the property is always
    included.

:octicons-unlock-24: &nbsp; __Feature flag__

:   Most of the features are hidden behind feature flags, which means they must
    be explicitly enabled via `mkdocs.yml`. This allows for the existence of
    potentially orthogonal features.

:octicons-beaker-24: &nbsp; __Experimental__

:   Some newer features are still considered experimental, which means they
    might (although rarely) change at any time, including their complete removal 
    (which hasn't happened yet).


:octicons-cpu-24: &nbsp; __Plugin__

:   Several features are implemented through MkDocs excellent plugin
    architecture, some of which are built-in and distributed with Material for
    MkDocs, so no installation is required.

:octicons-package-24: &nbsp; __Utility__

:   Besides plugins, there are some utilities that build on top of MkDocs in
    order to provide extended functionality, like for example support for
    versioning.
